title: Specificity
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The frequency with which a test shows a true negative result among individuals who do not have the disease or the genetic variant in question. A test with high specificity has a low false-positive rate, which means it does a good job of correctly identifying unaffected individuals or noncarriers of a genetic variant.
